This repository contains a News Chatbot Web Application that allows users to interact with current news articles through a conversational interface. Designed to make news exploration intuitive and engaging, the application consists of a FastAPI backend with a MongoDB database, and a React-based frontend. Powered by Llama-2, the chatbot enables users to ask questions, get summaries, and receive filtered news on demand.

Features
1. Full-Stack Web Application
This application provides a complete, responsive web-based solution where users can interact with news data through a chatbot, available from any web browser.

Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and React, the frontend presents a user-friendly interface where users can engage with the chatbot and view responses dynamically.
Backend: The FastAPI-based backend manages data flow between MongoDB and the chatbot interface, ensuring smooth communication and data retrieval.
2. Chatbot Interface Powered by Llama-2
The chatbot is powered by Llama-2, enabling natural language understanding and interaction with stored news data. Through the chatbot, users can:

Ask questions about recent events, specific topics, or articles by a particular author.
Request summaries or detailed explanations of news stories.
Filter results based on criteria like publication date, topic, or location.
